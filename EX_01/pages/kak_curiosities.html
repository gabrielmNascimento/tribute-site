            <h2 class="num-curio">1.</h2>
            <p>The first kanji in Kakuzu's name (角) stands for kakugyō, the bishop in shōgi. While similarly, 
                the kanji in his partner Hidan's name means "rook", another shōgi piece.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="curiosities-elements">
            <h2 class="num-curio">2.</h2>
            <p>Kakuzu is the oldest shinobi whose age is known.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="curiosities-elements">
            <h2 class="num-curio">3.</h2>
            <p>Kakuzu's birthday corresponds with the astrological sign Leo, who rules the heart, 
                the organ Kakuzu collected from defeated enemies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="curiosities-elements">
            <h2 class="num-curio">4.</h2>
            <p>Kishimoto first intended to make Akatsuki's members monsters with almost no human traits. 
                Zetsu, Kisame and Kakuzu (and, to a lesser extent, Deidara and Sasori) are prime examples of this. 
                Kakuzu, in particular, has traits derived from a Kuchisake-onna (口裂け女, 
                literally meaning: Slit-Mouthed Woman), 
                a Japanese mythological figure who has a slit across her mouth from ear to ear (as with Kakuzu's), 
                which is hidden under a surgical mask (as Kakuzu also hid his mouth under a similar mask).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="curiosities-elements">
            <h2 class="num-curio">5.</h2>
            <p>Many of Kakuzu's techniques are named after various mecha from Mobile Suit Gundam 
                (機動戦士ガンダム, Kidō Senshi Gandamu). In Chapter 60, 
                Kishimoto mentioned his interest in the show in the third segment of his child history. 
                He used to draw Zaku, Gifu (Gouf), Domu (Dom), Jimu (GM), and Dozuruzabi (Dozle Zabi).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="curiosities-elements">
            <h2 class="num-curio">6.</h2>
            <p>Although covered by his hood, Kakuzu had shoulder length dark brown hair, but in the anime, 
                it was depicted reaching down to his lower back.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="curiosities-elements">
            <h2 class="num-curio">7.</h2>
            <p>When Kakuzu first appeared as a hologram at the end of Part I, 
                he was clearly the tallest Akatsuki member there, 
                a fact reinforced when he appeared during Gaara's sealing ritual.[27] However, 
                when he truly appeared with Hidan, he was much shorter, 
                and the third databook stated that he was shorter than Kisame.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="curiosities-elements">
            <h2 class="num-curio">8.</h2>
            <p>Kakuzu's unusually coloured eyes were similar to those of Hanzō.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="curiosities-elements">
            <h2 class="num-curio">9.</h2>
            <p>Both Hidan and Kakuzu's faces appeared on a pair of lanterns in the omake of Shippūden episode 129, 
                Kakuzu being on the right and Hidan on the left.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="curiosities-elements">
            <h2 class="num-curio">10.</h2>
            <p>Kakuzu, along with Hidan, gets a mention in Naruto Shippūden: Dragon Blade Chronicles for the Wii,
                 when Tobi mentions "monsters" with traits of the two 
                 (arms that can be stretched and the ability to survive decapitation), 
                 before Deidara notes how he is talking about the pair's abilities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="curiosities-elements">
            <h2 class="num-curio">11.</h2>
            <p>The markings on Kakuzu's forearms suggest that he has been in prison at some point, 
                as such tattoos were used during Edo period in Japan to identify criminals according to the institution they were in.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="curiosities-elements">
            <h2 class="num-curio">12.</h2>
            <p>Kakuzu's favourite food was liver sashimi and monkfish liver, while his least was Chestnut jelly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="curiosities-elements">
            <h2 class="num-curio">13.</h2>
            <p>He wished to fight anyone with a high bounty.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="curiosities-elements">
            <h2 class="num-curio">14.</h2>
            <p>His hobby was reading (old/rare books).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="curiosities-elements">
            <h2 class="num-curio">15.</h2>
            <p>Kakuzu's favourite phrase was "If you're prepared, there won't be any sorrow" 
                (備えあれば憂いなし, Sonae areba urei nashi).</p>
