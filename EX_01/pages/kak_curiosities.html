            <p>The first kanji in Kakuzu's name (角) stands for kakugyō, the bishop in shōgi. While similarly, 
                the kanji in his partner Hidan's name means "rook", another shōgi piece.</p>

            <p>Kakuzu is the oldest shinobi whose age is known.</p>

        <div class="curiosities-elements">
            <h2 class="num-curio">3.</h2>
            <p>Kakuzu's birthday corresponds with the astrological sign Leo, who rules the heart, 
                the organ Kakuzu collected from defeated enemies.</p>

            <p>Kishimoto first intended to make Akatsuki's members monsters with almost no human traits. 
                Zetsu, Kisame and Kakuzu (and, to a lesser extent, Deidara and Sasori) are prime examples of this. 
                Kakuzu, in particular, has traits derived from a Kuchisake-onna (口裂け女, 
                literally meaning: Slit-Mouthed Woman), 
                a Japanese mythological figure who has a slit across her mouth from ear to ear (as with Kakuzu's), 
                which is hidden under a surgical mask (as Kakuzu also hid his mouth under a similar mask).</p>
