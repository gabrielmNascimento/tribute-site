                Kakuzu was an S-rank missing-nin from Takigakure and an old member of Akatsuki who partnered with Hidan
                and many others, when in service of Takigakure, Kakuzu took a mission to assassinate Hashirama Senju,
                The first Hokage. This mission, however was a fail and the ancients from Takigakure punished Kakuzu very hard
                to lost the battle to the God of Shinobis. They imprisioned Kakuzu and because of this, Kakuzu started to hold
                a violent hatred for the ancients, after he escpade the imprisonment, he killed every ancient of Takigakura and
                stole their hearts to use for a forbidden technique who permits him to have 5 hearts and absorbs the nature powers
                of the ex-owners of the hearts. With this technique, Kakuzu reaches to an imortal body.
            </p>
            <p class="article-text">
                So, Kakuzu start his life after escape the prison, he loves money and starts to hunt persons who death grant him a
                huge value in money. After years hunting persons, he joined the Akatsuki, the biggest criminal organization in the
                world. In the Akatsuki, Kakuzu became the treasurer because of his good money control, he had a lot of partners in
                the organization, but Kakuzu killed them until Hidan, an imortal guy became his partner, so Kakuzu can't kill him.
                Kakuzu concluded a lot of missions with Akatsuki and captured 3 jinchurikis, one of the most valuable members of
                the team.

            <p class="article-text">
                When he and hidan decided to capture the 9 tails jinchuriki, Naruto Uzumaki, they found a lot of problems, first they
                fighted four shinobis of konoha: Kotetsu, Izumo, Shikamaru Nara and Asuma Sarutobi, Kakuzu let Hidan fought with they,
                after a blooded battle, Hidan killed Asuma, a highjounin of Konohagakure and after this, they run out of the battlefield,
                because Pain called them to extract the bijuu from anoter jinchuriki. Some days later, Kakuzu and Hidan going directly to
                Konohagakure, they were cornered by a plan of Shikamaru Nara who sought revenge because the death of his sensei Asuma Sarutobi,
                the Zombie Combo (Kakuzu and Hidan), fought now versus four Konoha's Shinobi: Shikamaru Nara, Kakashi Hatake, Ino Yamanaka and
                Choji Akimichi. Shikamaru's plan was fight in an one versus one with Hidan, while Kakashi, Ino and Choji fight with Kakuzu.
                Kakuzu was injured in one of his hearts by Kakashi Hatake's Chidori, after this Kakuzu showed the power of his hearts and fought
                a great fight against Kakashi, however Shikamaru's Plan was succesfull, when Kakashi hitted Kakuzu with a chidori, he collected
                the blood of Kakuzu and give it to Shikamaru, after this Shikamaru runs to the forest to battle alone against Hidan and do Hidan
                make his ritual to Jashin with Kakuzu's blood, when the ritual was completed, and Hidan hurted himself with his scythe in the belly
                Kakuzu felt the pain, this damaged Kakuzu a lot, but his hearts keep the fight against Kakashi, Ino and Choji. Later on, reinforcements
                joined with Kakashi, more 4 Konoha's shinobis: Yamato, Sai, Sakura Haruno and Naruto Uzumaki, the jinchuriki of 9 tails went directly
                to him, so Kakuzu decided to defeat Naruto to get his bijuu. But Naruto developed a mortal technique and decided to use against Kakuzu,
                in the first try, he miss, but in the second he hit Kakuzu and killed him.

            <p class="article-text">
                Kakuzu returned to life with Kabuto's Edo Tensei, and fought with Akatsuki and Tobi in the fourth shinobi war against the Shinobi Alliance,
